Enzyme-Ligand Docking
This repository contains a program for docking a ligand on an enzyme with a bound cofactor, as well as utility functions for preparing the enzyme and ligand files for docking, finding the best binding pocket, and creating a reaction graph of the complex. The program uses the GPU-accelerated docking software Gnina for docking, P2Rank for finding the best binding pocket, AutoDock Tools for preparing the enzyme and ligand files, BagPype and PyTorch Geometric for creating the reaction graph.

Installation
To use the program, you will need to have the following installed:

Gnina
P2Rank
AutoDock Tools
BagPype
PyTorch Geometric
